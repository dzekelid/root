    This reference string can be used to copy that file to another user's Dropbox by passing it in as the
    `from_copy_ref` parameter on [/fileops/copy](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#fileops-copy).

          * `PUBLIC` - anyone can view
          * `TEAM_ONLY` - only the owner's team can view
          * `PASSWORD` - a password is required

          * `SHARED_FOLDER_ONLY` - only [members](https://www.dropbox.com/help/6636) of the enclosing shared folder can view

        Note that other values may be added at any time.

        Returns a link directly to a file.

        Similar to [/shares](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#shares). The difference is that this
        bypasses the Dropbox webserver, used to provide a preview of the file, so that you can effectively stream
        the contents of your media. This URL should not be used to display content directly in the browser.

        The `/media` link expires after four hours, allotting enough time to stream files, but not enough to leave
        a connection open indefinitely.
